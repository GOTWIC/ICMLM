# ICMLM

This repo contains the code and dataset for ICMLM, a project that builds language models to generate Indian Classical Music Composistions.

For now, this repo will remain blank. Once I finish finetuning LLAMA, I will upload all my files and write a thorough description here.

A brief breakdown of what you can expect:

 - Code for ICMSLM
 - Code for ICMMLM
 - Code for GPT Finetuning
 - Code for LLAMA Finetuning
 - Code for Formatting Dataset for GPT + LLAMA
 - Code for converting our notation to Taalmaata Notation
 - Dataset
